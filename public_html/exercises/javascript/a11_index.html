		<h2>Programming Languages Portfolio</h2>
		<h3>Overview</h3>
	</div>

	<p>My web portfolio currently utilizes hand-coded HTML and CSS - I am not utilizing a CMS. I use bootstrap in order to make my design responsive. The majority of this site is written in   
		HTML, CSS and PHP, with some JavaScript utilized. The purpose of this site is to show employers and prospective clients my development knowledge and skills. It is <em>not</em>
		intended to be a resume or an exhaustive list of my skills; rather, it is intended to showcase my <em>development</em> skills in particular.  
		The latest, greatest, web technologies and practices may not be utilized on this site. This site will not express all of my development skills (e.g., my experience with FoundationPress and WordPress). For an exahustive list, see my 
		<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=12ZRP4QAscSmYTV_asuhzIBC6aWChXRGCaseGKdQFgm4" target="_blank">resume</a> (opens in new tab).

		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<!-----------------------Web Experiences------------>
		<h3>Web Design Experiences</h3>

		<h4>Reasons for Taking the Course</h4>
		<p>I am taking this course for several reasons. First, it is a necessary part of the course load I need to take so that I can graduate. I would <em>also</em> potentially
		like to get into professional web development; at the moment, I am not entirely sure what this would look like. I don't know whether I want to try to get a 
		web design job with a company or work as a freelancer. I enjoy the design element of web site creation more than the "logic-based" elements such as processing, etc., but I also know that design tends to be easier and less prevalent in terms of jobs.</p>
		<h4>Experience</h4>
		<p>I honestly do not have a boatload of experience with Web design and development. I have taken courses in college, but I have never dived in deep in terms of
		my own personal learning. From what I understand, as far as web development goes, the proof is in the pudding; that is, it is possible to learn about Web design
		from a textbook for years, but the actual learning doesn't take place until you sit down and actually code. I am planning on doing more coding this semester on
		my own, simply to determine whether it is an interest I want to pursue professionally.</p>
		<h4>What do I want to learn?</h4>
		<p>I want to learn how to write JavaScript in this course. I want to know how to write client-side processing code and I want to know whether I'll be 
		able to do it in a professional setting.</p>

		<!------------------------Other About Me-------------->
		<h3>Other Things</h3>
		<p>When I'm not making web sites or fixing things at work, I like to do a lot of things. I play a number of different instruments and even
		record and produce my own music! If the opportunity arises, I would like to make some money performing and recording music.<br>
		I play the following instruments:</p>
		<h5>Instruments</h5>
		<dl>
			<dt>Guitar</dt>
				<dd>6 String. Mainly acoustic.</dd>
			<dt>Drums</dt>
				<dd>Mainly drum kit.</dd>
			<dt>Bass Guitar</dt>
				<dd>4 String. I don't play nearly as much bass guitar as I do 6-string guitar!</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>I also enjoy digital photography and will travel to different locations to practice shooting.<br>
		I enjoy both playing and watching sports. My favorite sports team is the New England Patriots, and my favorite sport to play is basketball.<br>
		I own a 2008 Ford Ranger and enjoy driving it around the Seacoast and around New England.</p>

	<!---PRE notes-->
	<pre>
	One element I just learned about the other day is the PRE element. You can use it when you have a lot of 
	text
	that you
	may want to display just as you write it, so that you don't have to convert it all to HTML form.

	For instance, this will display, now, as a separate paragraph. Who knew!
	</pre>
